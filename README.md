## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**.
* Explore **sales trends across different outlets & product categories**.
* Analyze the **impact of item weight, fat content, and visibility on sales**.
* Compare **outlet size and type performance**.
* Visualize **customer ratings and product popularity**.


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

## 📈 Example Insights (Expected)

* Outlets in **Tier-3 cities** show higher average sales compared to Tier-1.
* **Supermarket Type1** contributes the majority of overall sales.
* **Low Fat items** are more frequently purchased than Regular fat items.
* Higher **item visibility** correlates with higher sales.
